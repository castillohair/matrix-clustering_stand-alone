# matrix-clustering_stand-alone
This is a stand-alone version of RSAT matrix-clustering. This version is faster and simplified compared to the original RSAT matrix-clustering but the graphical output is still under development.

WARNING: This repository is under active development, so we expect many changes as long as you see this line.

Originally, matrix-clustering was planned to be part of the RSAT suite (http://www.rsat.eu/) for motif analysis, we decided to create a portable stand-alone version that can be ran without installing the whole RSAT environment.

If you want to run the original version with all the graphical output, you can do it thorugh RSAT website: http://rsat-tagc.univ-mrs.fr/rsat/matrix-clustering_form.cgi
