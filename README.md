# matrix-clustering_stand-alone
This is a stand-alone version of RSAT matrix-clustering. This version is faster and simplified compared to the original RSAT matrix-clustering but the graphical output is still under development.

Originally, matrix-clustering was planned to be part of the RSAT suite (http://www.rsat.eu/) for motif analysis, we decided to create a portable stand-alone version that can be ran without installing the whole RSAT environment.
