# matrix-clustering_stand-alone
This is a stand-alone version of RSAT matrix-clustering. This version is faster and simplified compared to the original RSAT matrix-clustering but the graphical output is still under development.

Originally, matrix-clustering was planned to be part of the RSAT suite (http://www.rsat.eu/) for motif analysis, we decided to create a portable stand-alone version that can be ran without installing the whole RSAT environment.


## Before starting

If you want to run the original version with all the graphical output, you can do it thorugh RSAT website: http://rsat-tagc.univ-mrs.fr/rsat/matrix-clustering_form.cgi

WARNING: This repository is under active development, so we expect many changes as long as you see this line.

The graphical output (interactive trees and heatmap will be added soon).
